Click on "Import" in the top left corner.
Select the ecommerce_postman_collection.json file.
Click "Import".
After importing, you will see the collection in your Postman, and you can test all the endpoints.

Notes:
The {{authToken}} variable is a placeholder for the JWT token. After logging in, you should set this variable in Postman to test the protected routes (Add to Cart, Remove from Cart, Get Cart Data).
Replace localhost with the actual host if your server is running on a different machine or port.
This should help you test all your API endpoints easily in Postman!
